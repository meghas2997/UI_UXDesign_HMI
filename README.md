# UI_UXDesign_HMI

Development of a mobile and adaptive human machine interface for the technical maintenance of an elevator which will guide the user with a certified checklist.We have used two sensors for the applicaton i.e. the camera with QR-Codes and the accelerometer. This application also have vibration and flashlight as the output services. 

The application is designed by using at least two iterations of the UX design process. We implemented the solutions step by step using scribbles, wireframes, mockup and finally a working prototype on the mobile phone with the Cordova Web-based application development environment. In the end, there is short demonstration video showing our proposed application with all its features and design processes. 

## Steps Included while designing the Application 
 ### Analysis 
1. Idnetification of the requirements of our application '
2. Identification of the users for the application
3. Identification of stakeholders for the applicaton 
4. Survey done to understand the utility of the application
5. creation of personas 

### Conception
3 iterations were made in order to understand the usability of the application

1. Tasks assigned for the working of the application in a good flow 
2. card sorting of relevant buiding blocks by the users to determine the usability and user experience
3. creation of scribbles to understand the design of the application 
4. creation of a wireframe to understand the flow of the working of application and changing or improving the desgin and development of the app in further iterations and repeating the steps.

### App Developement 
after finalizing the design and features of the application through 2 iterations, there was development of the prototype with cordova and android studio

### Evaluation 
For understanding the user experience, a survey was done to get the feedback of different design layouts. 

All the steps and development was done by keeping the UI and UX design aspects like typography, color schemes, screen positoning etc.
